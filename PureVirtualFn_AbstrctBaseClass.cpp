/*
Pure Virtual Functions in C++
Pure virtual function is a function that doesnâ€™t perform any operation and the function is declared by assigning the value 0 to it. Pure virtual functions are declared in abstract classes.
If pure virtual function is declared then you have to make same function in  Inherited class otherwise it will throw error.

Abstract Base Class in C++
Abstract base class is a class that has at least one pure virtual function in its body. The classes which are inheriting the base class must need to override the virtual function of the abstract class otherwise compiler will throw an error.
